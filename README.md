# Semantic Web and Linked Data Project
**By Jun Smith**

## Project Rundown
This repository is for the purpose of developing an API by combining the two datasets of [poverty rates - SIA15](http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?MainTable=SIA15&PLanguage=0&PXSId=0) and [recorded crime offences - CJA01](http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=CJA01&PLanguage=0) in Ireland, ranging from 2004 to 2013 on a year-to-year basis as both datasets share said years in common. Both datasets have been sourced from the Irish Central Statistics Office web site.

## Database to be used
This API will use a document database likely either Couchbase or MongoDB as they are scalable as information gathered may be ongoing and updated in the datasets.
