# Semantic Web Linked Project

**By Jun Smith**

## Project Rundown
This project is developed with the intention to combine the two datasets of [poverty rates - SIA15](http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?MainTable=SIA15&PLanguage=0&PXSId=0) and [recorded crime offences - CJA01](http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=CJA01&PLanguage=0) in Ireland, ranging from 2004 to 2013 as both datasets share said years in common. Both datasets have been sourced from the Irish Central Statistics Office web site.

This repository is for the purpose of developing an API by combining the two datasets of [poverty rates - SIA15](http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?MainTable=SIA15&PLanguage=0&PXSId=0) and [recorded crime offences - CJA01](http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=CJA01&PLanguage=0) in Ireland, ranging from 2004 to 2013 on a year-to-year basis as both datasets share said years in common. Both datasets have been sourced from the Irish Central Statistics Office web site.

## Database to be used
This API will use SQLite3 which is a transactional database engine as it is best suited for relatively small datasets and is ideal for low traffic websites (Less than 100,000 hits per day).
