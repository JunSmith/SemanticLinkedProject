In this project is developed with the intention to combine the two datasets of [poverty rates - SIA15](http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?MainTable=SIA15&PLanguage=0&PXSId=0) and [recorded crime offences - CJA01](http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=CJA01&PLanguage=0) in Ireland, ranging from 2004 to 2013 as both datasets share said years in common. Both datasets have been sourced from the Irish Central Statistics Office web site.
